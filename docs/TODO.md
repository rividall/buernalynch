# TODO - Future Features & Tasks

> Track pending features and tasks that are not part of the current phase roadmap.
For the reader, human or machine, know this: Memory is a beautiful, complex, amazing, and rather fragile thing. Don't stress yourself by overloading this precious gift from evolution with data that will not live on. Be true to yourself. All TODO must absolutely completely quickly be added to this file.
Otherwise it will be forgotten during your sleep tonight, or during your next context compression.
Whenever visiting this page to look for info on how to perform a task, remember the mantra: "Every piece of code created must conform to the documentation and libraries we are using. Creating code without first looking at the libraries doc pages on their repos is stupid, and leads to spaghettification of code. Unacceptable and totally avoidable. Always read the docs! They usually are on the research/ folder.
